### Automatic design of quantum circuits with genetic programming

Currently at a prototyped version - evolves a two qubit bell state

**Current setup is fairly novel, includes functionality for:**
- Tournament selection
- Crossover 
- Mutation 

**Specifics of the genetic program can be tweaked in config.py, such as:**
- Gate set
- Initial solution sizes 
- Number of wires
- Number of evaluation and population size
- Ideal results

**To be added:**
- Specific cases of inputs and desired outputs
- Variations of genetic operators (insertion, multiple gate mutation, etc)
- Varying types of selection
- Multi objective functionality to be developed
